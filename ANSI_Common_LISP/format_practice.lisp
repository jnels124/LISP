;; Formatting -> Chapter 11

;; Format can also loop through data using 犷
;; General format -> 
;; (format destination-param "control string ? more text" value-param)
;;                                       The  represents start of control sequence
;;                                         : the ? must be a valid control sequence
;; Vaild destination params : 
;;         nil-> Just creates a string 
;;         t-> Print to the console 
;;         stream-> output to the stream
;;

;; Vaild control sequences :  
;;         $ -> monetary floating point number 
;;         s -> Same behaviour as prin1 
;;         a -> Same behavior as princ
;;         % -> Same as using (terpri) which creates a new line in all cases
;;         & -> Same as using (fresh-line) which creates a new line only if needed
;;              both % and & can be prefixed with a number to indicate the number
;;                 of new lines
;;         t -> Display items in a table
;;                 takes a parameter that specifies the column position at which formatted 
;;                      value should appear

;; The following are used for controlling the appearence of numbers :
;;         x -> Displays a number in hexadecimal form
;;         b -> Displays a number in binary form
;;         d -> Display a number as decimal
;;         f -> Formats floating point numbers 
;;               1st param to f -> formats restult to the exact width
;;               2nd param to f -> controls the number digits diplayed after the decimal
;;               3rd param to f -> Causes the number to be scaled by a factor of 10
;;         
;; Control sequences can accept multiple paramaters
;;          1st param -> Controls the final width of final formated string 
;;          2nd param -> Tells format command to add spaces in groups of specified integer
;;          3rd param -> Controls the exact number of spaces to add to the end of formatted string
;;          4th param-> Specifies which character will be used for padding 
;; EX:   
(format t "Add onion rings for only $ dollars more!" 1.5) 
  ;; -> Add onion rings for only 1.50 dollars more!


(princ (reverse
	(format nil "Add onion rings for only $ dollars more!" 1.5)))
  ;;-> !erom srallod 05.1 ylno rof sgnir noino Add
  ;;  The format function returns a string to the reverese funtion which is then printed
  ;;     to the screen by using princ. Rememaber princ prints things to the screen so a 
  ;;     human can easily understand it 


;; Using s control sequence
(format t "I am printinting s in the middle of this sentence" "foo")
;;     -> I am printing "foo" in the middle of this sentence

;; Using a control sequence 
(format t "I am printing a in the middle of this sentence" "foo")
;;     -> I am printing foo in the middle of this sentence.

;; Manipulating contol sequence with digit. Digit represents length to pad result to
(format t "I am printing 10a within 10 spaces of room." "foo")
;;     -> I am printing foo       within 10 spaces of room.
;;     This control sequence pads the value paramter's result to the right 

;; To pad the result to the left do this 
(format t "I am printing 10@a within 10 spaces of room." "foo")
;;     -> I am printing       foo within 10 spaces of room.


;;This second paramater tells the format command to add spaces in groups
;;      of three until the goal width of 10 is reached. In this example 9 spaces
;;        were added to the formatted value for a total width of 12

;; Keep in mind the second param to the control sequence is rarely used 
(format t "I am printing 10,3a within ten (or more) soaces of room." "foo")
;;     -> I am printing foo          within ten (or more) spaces of room


;; Regardless of length, formats the final value by appending exactly the 
;;  Speciifed number of spaces to the end of the value.
(format t "I am printing ,,4a in the middle of this sentence" "foo")
;;     -> I am printing foo     in the middle of this sentence
;;         -> in this case 4 spaces are added to the end of foo

;;Padds the result with ! instead of spaces. 
(format t "The word ,,4,'!a feels very important." "foo")
;;     -> The word foo!!!! feels very important.

;; Same as above but result is padded to the left instead
(format t "The word ,,4,'!@a feels very important." "foo")
;;     -> The word !!!!foo feels very important.

;; Prints number in hexadecimal form 
(format t "The number 1000 in hexadecimal is x" 1000)
;;      -> The number 1000 in hexadecimal is 3E8

;; Prints number in binary form 
(format t "The number 1000 in hexadecimal is b" 1000)
;;      -> The number 1000 in binary is 1111101000

;; Prints number in decimal form
;; although the number is alredy in decimal form, specifying it this way allows
;;     additonal formating options to be used 
(format t "The number 1000 in decimal is d" 1000)
;;      ->  The number 1000 in decimal is 1000
;;In this example, a would have given the same thing but see the following

;; Prints out decimal with commas between digit groups
;;    The : triggers this feature
(format t "Numbers with commas in them are :d" 1000000)
;;      -> Numbers with commas in them are 1,000,000

;; You can still set the padding paramater like before.
(format t "I am printing 10d within ten spaces of room." 1000000)
;;      -> I am printing     1000000 within ten spaces of room.

;; To change the character used for padding, pass the desired character as the 
;;       second parameter.
(format t "I am printing 10,'xd within ten spaces of room" 1000000)
;;      -> I am printing xxx1000000 within ten spaces of room 

;; Automatically rounds result to specified length
(format t "PI can be estimated as 4f" 3.141593)
;;      -> PI can be estimated as 3.14

;; Will print the specifed number of values after the decimal point
(format t "PI can be estimated as ,4f" 3.141593)
;;      -> PI can be estimated as 3.1416

;; Since pi is a common lisp constant you can also rewrite above command as 
(format t "PI can be estimated as ,4f" pi)
;;      -> PI can be estimated as 3.146

;; Scales the number by factors of 10
(format t "Percentages are ,,2f percent better than fractions" 0.77)
;;      -> Percentages are 77.0 percent better tha fractions

;; Use $ to format currencies 
(format t "I wish I had $ dollars in my bank account." 1000000.2)

;; THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES DEAL WITH PRINTING MULTIPLE LINES OF OUTPUT
;;   There are two different commands for starting a new line durring printing
;;      terpri(%) -> tells lisp to terminate the current line and start a new one for 
;;                for pinting the rest of the output.
;;      fresh-line(&) -> Starts a new line only if the cursor in the repel isn't already
;;                    at the front of a new line 


;; Example of terpri
(progn (princ 22)
       (terpri)
       (princ 33))
;;       -> 22
;;          33

(progn (princ 22)
       (terpri)
       (terpri)
       (princ 33))
;;       -> 22
;;
;;          33

;; Example of fresh-line
(progn (princ 22)
       (fresh-line)
       (princ 33))
;;       -> 22
;;          33

(progn (princ 22)
       (fresh-line)
       (fresh-line)
       (princ 33))
;;       -> 22
;;          33

(progn (format t "this is on one line %")
       (format t "%this is on another line"))
;;       -> this is on one line
;;
;;          this is on another line

(progn (format t "this is on one line &")
       (format t "&this is on another line"))
;;       -> this is on one line
;;          this is on another line

;; Prints a specified number of fresh lines
(format t "this will print 5%on two lines spread far apart")
;;       -> this will print 
;;
;;
;;
;;
;;
;;          on two lines spread far apart 

;; Function returns a random animal. Function used in
;;    the following text justification examples.
(defun random-animal ()
  (nth (random 5) '("dog" "tick" "tiger" "walrus" "Kangaroo")))

;; The control sequenece creats a table with three columns
;;    the first columns value will be at character position 5
;;    the second column's value will start at 15 
;;    the third column's value will start at 25
;; You can create as many columns as you want by continuing to specify additonal control sequences
(loop repeat 10 
      do (format t "5ta 15ta 25ta%"
		 (random-animal)
		 (random-animal)
	         (random-animal)))


;; This will space the animals equally apart on each line
;;    this may format each line but the columns are still a mess 
(loop  repeat 10
       do (format t "30<a;a;a>%"
		  (Randomc-animal)
		  (random-animal)
		  (random-animal)))    
;; 30<   -> Start justifying.   Whole line will be 30 characters
;; a     -> put one of the three values here
;; ;     -> Start new item to justify.... indicates where to start spacing
;; a     -> put one of the three values here
;; ;     -> Start new item to justify
;; a     -> put one of the three values here
;; >     -> Stop justifying 
;; %     -> Print a new line character

;; we can create alligned columns by adding the :@ flag to the jutification
;;    this example only formats a single column
(loop repeat 10
      do (format t "30:@<a>%" (random-animal)))

;; Centers on each line with extra space at left and right ends
;;    This gets you a little close to having fully formatted rows and columns
(loop repeat 10
      do (format t "30:@<a;a;a>%" 
		 (random-animal)
		 (random-animal)
		 (random-animal)))
;;    -> lines are still wavy because we're alligning the values within a single line
;;        without telling format to arrange the values using three centered columns

;; Creates three sepearate sections of 10 characters each and centers one value
;;   in each of the 10 character sections creating a perfectly formatted table 
(loop repeat 10
      do (format t "10:@<a>10:@<a>10:@<a>%" 
		 (random-animal)
		 (random-animal)
		 (random-animal)))


;; List of animals to use in looping with format command example
(defparameter *animals* 
  (loop repeat 10 
	collect (random-animal)))

;; now use format to loop through animals
(format t "箦帷" *animals*)

;; You can also grab more than one item from a list 
(format t "箦岙矧麽轸峥" *animals*)

;; Uses some old and some new control sequences together to show
